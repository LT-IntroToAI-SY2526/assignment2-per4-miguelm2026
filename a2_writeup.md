# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

Working with loops made it very diffucut to work with the match function. Specifically the pattern, it just wasn't really clear how source and pattern were supposed to work together, like checking the value with the pattern made a little more sense. It also wasnt the traditonal if statements so that was even more confusing to me.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

You can use the match function to search through a data base to gather title, genre and etc. The match function would check each entry in the database for patterns that you are looking for. The match function won't blindly check everything but it would be look for the information that was provided such as title, genre and etc with patterns.
